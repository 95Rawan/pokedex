# Week 1 Self-Assessment Form

## Technical Skills

- Could you describe which technical topic you had most trouble with?

  I had to continue my work on the client's project until Wednesday this week, so I didn't have the time to go through the whole course topics.

  I think the DOM was hard because it has been so long since I worked with it and to go from React concepts and how smooth and easy to manipulate data to a more basic approach was hard for me.

- What’s your plan for improving your understanding of it?

  This week I'll be finishing the front end so I'll have more time to really get into the DOM and understand it more.

## Soft Skills

- How can this week’s concept(​GrowthMindset​) help you be a better professional?

  The ​GrowthMindset​ concept teaches you that you don't suck by design, you can always improve on your skills whether they are personal or technical skill.

  This helps when you're striving to be a better professional because this way of thinking will allow you to take in more challenges and be more resilient which results in growing.

  It also helps you be better to yourself and not compare yourself with others, instead you compare yourself today with your past self and always strive to be better at your own pace, which is something that I need to keep reminding myself of.

- What is 1 practical way of practicing this concept to improve yourself?

  Always be open to new challenges and get out of your comfort zone which is something I always tried to do even before I knew about the growth mindset.

  I would always participate in things that are new to me and that I can't get out off so I wouldn't chicken out at the last minute and I'll be forced to do it and grow my skills.

## Business Awareness

- How would you describe Kiitos’ company culture?

  Kittos' culture is what made me want to be part of it in the first place. I saw how the company treated its employees and I was hooked. The homey feeling, the inclusiveness of different people from different backgrounds, the 50/50 opportunities for men and women, always trying to be better as a company and striving for improving itself, the people in it and the world around it, always asking for feedback from the employees, all these things make up for a great company that I would like to be a part of in the long run.

- How does Kiitos make money?
  From taking different projects from clients and from funding from the government and private sectors.
