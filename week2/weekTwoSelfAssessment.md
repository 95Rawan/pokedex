## Soft Skills

- How can this week’s concept(​Time management​)help you be a better professional?

  By better managing your time you can have a better sense of what you have on your plate that day and thus prioritize important tasks, do better work, be more productive, avoid double booking appointments and then apologizing for it, know what free time you have and decide how to spend it and what to do with it and with whom.

- What’s your main source of procrastination and what’s 1 solution for it?

  - I procrastinate because I'm running away from feeling bad about the task at hand, |I don't want to feel that I'm not smart enough or knowledgeable enough to do the task.

  - The way to handle this is by growing a growth mindset and taking the tasks as good challenges that will help me grow for the better.

- Why is energy management just as important as time management?
  Because you can have all the time in the world and not be productive if you don't have enough energy to do the work.

## Business Awareness

- From a business perspective, why should we write reusable code?
  Because it will save time, money, and resources since it's already done and all I have to do is just use it.

  An example of this are the packages we use in our projects, someone already wrote something that is needed by more than one person in more than one situation and you can just take that code and apply it in your project. Same goes for middlewares for instance or other types of reuseable code.

- Why is time estimation for software development so important?
  - To be able to plan for the project.
  - Divide project's tasks.
  - Estimate the budget.
  - Give the client a delivery day so they can organize their time and marketing around that.
  - Estimate the overall performance of your team on the project, get all the information and do better next time.
